# GRAPHQL_API
* Setting up a GraphQl API Server in Node.js that serves up a GraphQL endpoint
* A GraphQL schema was built based on the GraphQL type system. including the operations, such as queries and mutations and resolver functions to generate responses for any 
requests. 
* The GRAPHQL IDE was used to explore and debug your schema and query the GraphQL API from a client.
* Pre-requisites:
Installing an express HTTP Server: npm install express and cors (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware) this cors middleware will allow easy access from the server to the 
browser.
Also i installed npm i nodemon as a dev dependency: is a tool that helps develop Node-based applications 
by automatically restarting the application when file changes in the directory are detected.
Other packages will be created such as node_modules and packae.json.
To make it easier to develop on the server, the script is edited to "devStart" that will run nodemon index.js.
Finally, a type of module was added to ensure the use of the import statements.
